# WatirScripts

## Automation for Connection

These scripts are written in Ruby to perform the following tasks:
  1. Open the web browser
  2. Log into LinkedIn
  3. Search for someone with whom you are not connected*
  4. Select their profile
  5. Compose a message containing a link to this repo and an invite to set up an appointment to talk about feedback/ideas re: this project and programming in general
  
  *<sub><sup>This project only works for sending messages to people with whom you are not already connected. Maybe next I'll write a script that messages existing connections :thinking::thinking::thinking:</sub></sup> 

## The Tests

### Test 1: Static (demo.rb)
This test completes all of the tasks above in order to reach out to Michael 'Fritz' Fritzius -\-who challenged me to write these scripts (Hi, Fritz!)-\- by hardcoding his name to the file.

### Test 2: User Input (demo_user_input.rb)
This test prompts the user for input to search for a specific person

### Test 3: Contact List (demo_contact_list.rb)
This test uses the 'csv' gem to iterate over a list of names to search for each name by only running the script once!

Thanks for taking the time to look, and feel free to use my script to add me on LinkedIn :)
