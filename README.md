# WatirScripts

## Automation for Connection

This is ![Ruby](./ruby_smile.jpg), my 4 year old pup. I had heard that there was a scripting language called Ruby, and I thought it to be a cute coincidence at best-- little did I know that it's actually a pretty quick language to learn to get to some pretty powerful testing! 

These scripts are written in Ruby to perform the following tasks:
  1. Open the web browser
  2. Log into LinkedIn
  3. Search for a someone with whom you are not connected*
  4. Select their profile
  5. Compose a message inviting them to connect and set up an appointment to talk about feedback

## The Tests

### Test 1: Static (demo.rb)
